# ZerrosBin

## Description

ZerrosBin is an experiment for me to learn and explore web development with Node.js and Express. It includes rate limiting and other middleware. The application allows users to create and retrieve pastes.

Dont expect this to work perfectly there will be bugs and probably not very secure in a production enviroment!

## Features

- Create and retrieve pastes
- Docker support for containerization

## To-do

- Persistence database
- Url expiry
- Image/file upload

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node package manager)
- Docker (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/callum5892/ZerrosBin.git
   npm install
   npm run start
